# a few chip-8 projects

currently just a chip-8 interpreter, disassembler, and assembler<br><br>
all currently unfinished<br><br>
I hope to eventually write both a JIT compiler and static recompiler, but idk if I'll ever get around to that<br><br>
the disassembler's output has names for each opcode given by me because I don't think there's any agreed upon names and I currently don't care enough to check<br><br>
the interpreter runs but has very clear bugs with at least one of the math opcodes<br><br>
both also have only been barely tested lmao<br><br>
